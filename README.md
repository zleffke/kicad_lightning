Lightning Detection KiCAD Projects

## Credit where its due! - [Blitzortung.org](https://www.blitzortung.org)
This project is heavily inspired by the awesome work at [Blitzortung.org](https://www.blitzortung.org).
I'm interested in making my own custom lightning detection devices, but not interested in reinventing the wheel.
Lots of simple lightning detectors schematic examples exist in various forms out on the internet (this is a 100+ year old DIY hobby after all).
So to get started, I've elected to attempt to recreate one of the best lightning detectors I could find, which are the [Blitzortung.org](https://www.blitzortung.org) devices.
They are good enough to publish the schematic of one of their detectors in their [System Red Project Description Page](https://www.blitzortung.org/en/cover_your_area.php).
I'd like to try to reproduce the analog front end component, and maybe try to rereate my own backend and direction finder (microcontroller based).
My work will be nowhere near as professional as theirs, and I have no intention of starting a separate network.
I just want to experiment with a lightning detector, direction of arrival system, and following in the footsteps of a qualtiy system.
I highly recommend interested readers check out their page and consider joining their community.
